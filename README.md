# How to Bike Around Pittsburgh For Free!

## Introduction
Coming from a year spent online, going to in person to classes has been an adjustment for me. Living in South Oakland doesn't help my case, as I'm now a 15-20 minute walk away from campus. However, I can cut that time down to 5 by using Next bikes that we get for free with our Student IDs. Though you only get 30 minutes worth of free riding time, that should be more than enough time to cross campus.
## Advisory Note ![Stop_sign.png](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qq5rbdb9e164c69/Stop_sign.png?dl=0&raw=1)
Make sure to obey all traffic laws and wear a helmet while riding to protect your safety.
## Steps:
### 1. Download the NextBike app ![Capture.PNG](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pfus3jmiskm3v76/Capture.PNG?dl=0&raw=1)
Go to whatever app store your phone has and download the NextBike app. 
### 2. Create an account using your phone number
The app will ask you for your phone number. Once you enter it, you will recieve a code to confirm that your account has been created. You may also be asked here to put in your payment information. If so, enter it and proceeed. However, some operating systems do this later, so be sure to have your information handy for when it does ask.
### 3. Connect your Pitt email address
On the app, press the three lines in the top left corner and navigate to Account Settings, and tap Profile. There, you will be able to enter your personal information, including email account. You MUST use your Pitt email if you want to get free rentals. 
### 4. Find an available bike near you
Upon opening the app, you will be greeted with a map showing local stations where bikes can be found. The app will tell you how many bikes are left at a station, so be sure to check whether bikes are available at a station before you visit it. Additionally, some stations let you reserve bikes, but I've yet to come across a station that allowed this. 
### 5. Planning ahead
This is an appropriate place to mention that you must return the bike to another NextBike station once you are done with your trip. Before you begin riding, make sure you find a station close to your destination. Several Pitt buildings and public spaces have the stations in close proximity so it shouldn't be too hard to find one, especially if you look around the map on the app.
### 6. Renting a bike ![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/73dgfxh00gixtr2/PXL_20210909_005829867.MP.jpg?dl=0&raw=1)
Once you have found a nearby station with bikes available, you can press the "Rent bike" button at the bottom of the map and allow it to access your camera. Using this, scan the QR code located near the tail of the bike. Upon doing this, you will be given a four digit code that, once tapped into the number pad on the back of the bike, will unlock the bike. Now, you can simply take the axel from out of the front wheel, place it in the indicated hole on the ride side of the bike (as shown in the picture), and begin riding!
### 7. Returning the bike ![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/u4y7kjzl3i71zfj/PXL_20210909_005835332.MP.jpg?dl=0&raw=1)
Once you arrive at your destination station, simply slide the disk on the left side of the front wheel into its designated slot on the bike and slide the axel between the wheel, into the hole on the right side of each parking station. Next, go back to the number pad and hit the red "X" or "c/p" button. The screen should tell you to press "ok" to return the bike, so hit the green OK button. Make sure the screen says "RETURNED", as not returning the bike properly will make it continue to run and charge you if you don't return it for an extended period of time. 
## Conclusion
While this may seem like a lot of work just to ride a bike for five minutes, once you go through the steps of creating your account and putting in your information, it's as easy as scanning a QR code and riding. Much of campus is designed to make it easy to bike around, so if you are ever running late or facing a thirty minute walk across campus, consider biking instead.
